# binary-primitives

The smallest possible prediction market.

This project implements a single binary YES/NO market with:
- fixed prices
- simple positions
- deterministic resolution

There is no automation, no AMM, and no orderbook.

This repo exists to define the **primitive**:
> a binary contract that pays $1 if true and $0 if false.

Everything else builds on this.
